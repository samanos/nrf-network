## Building

Make sure `bcm2835` symlink is pointing to a directory which contains [bcm2835](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/) library. By default symlink points to a sibling directory of this repository. Version of the library is specified in the contents of the symlink.

Build both transmitter and receiver binaries by running `build.sh`.
